By default, a new token is generate every 30 seconds by the mobile app.
In order to compensate for possible time-skew between the client and the server
we allow an extra token before and after the current time. This allows for a
experience porblems with pour time synchronization, you can increase the window
from its default size of 3 permitted codes (one previous code, the current
code, the next code) to 17 permitted codes (the 8 previouse codes, the current
code, and the 8 next codes). This will permit for a time skew of up to 4 minutes
between client and server.
Do you want to do so? (y/n) n

If the computer that you are logging into isn't hardened against brute-force
login attempts, you can enable rate-limiting for the authentication module.
By default, this limits attackers to no more than 3 login attempts every 30s.

My primary means of interacting with this PC is via SSH from a my desktop Windows PC or from a Macbook Air laptop anywhere in the house.
I've even gone so far as to install an SSH client on my Android smart device which let's me log in to my Linux PC from the comfort of my dinner table. This let's my Linux PC sit inconspicuously in the corner of my room, 
connected to a PSU, running continuously untouched as a low power server that I can connect to whenever I'd like to do some programming or work on this very blog. It even leaves the door wide open to further enhancements 
further down the line.</p><p>One of the key advantages I find to this setup is the consistent interface I have interacting with my Linux environment, regardless of which way I access it. Additionally, the flexibility and comfort of accessing it from anywhere
within my household is unexepectantly desirable, so much so that I even have a pet project in mind creating low power terminals - basically a glorified screen - to be able to connect to my server from specific physical locations.
<em>Not very rational, but it could make for a fun dive into electronics for a few months.</em></p><p>The setup is also exstensible. Using <code>tmux</code> with a minimal plugin to save and restore sessions whenever rebooting, and you basically have a permanently unbroken session. There's also the potential to do <code>X11 forwarding</code> <em>(probably not
recommended, security seems to be an issue with <code>X</code>)</em> to have access to the desktop experience, or further enhance it with software like <code>XQuartz</code> which allows you to create headless graphical sessions that you can connect to and
disconnect from in much the same way <code>tmux</code> does for terminal sessions. It even works over the net...</p><p>It didn't take long to beg the question if one could connect to the home network from the outside.</p><div class="big-0-0-8"><p>Potential Solutions</p></div><p>Three possible solutions presented themselves in order to achieve this desire to connect to my Linux PC from outside the local network, each with their pros and cons that will be briefly enumerated.</p><p>A VPN, particularly a self hosted VPN, has been touted on internet forums as being a solution. While this would make for an interesting project and something I <em>will</em> eventually invest time in to, this option was unfortunately
too heavy on the time commitment up front. I had started doing my research, but after spending the better part of a morning with little progress towards the ultimate goal made, I opted to throw in the towel and return to this
once my interest is piqued once more. Moreover, in my time spent reading, at no point was it ever made explicitly clear how a VPN security-wise replaces a properly hardened SSH connection, leaving me a bit confused about why
VPNs are often shared as a better alternative to port forwarding. A topic for another day.</p><p>The second solution, and my preferred pick, was to use an already existing platform's service - <a href="https://tailscal.com/kb/1017/install"><code>Tailscale</code></a>. <em>add footnote or reference or something to add statement that this is not an add or sponsored by tail scale, I hate that we have to say that nowadays</em>
Honestly, this service looks nigh on <em>perfect</em> for my use case. It comes with a free plan that's limited to just 3 different devices, but it allows quick and easy connection and networking between those devices in an easy to use
and capable manner. It provides many <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/116/vscode-ipad">relevant examples</a> as well as <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1137/minecraft">interesting examples</a> to help demonstrate the capabilities and get you started
quickly, I feel I owe it to my future self to eventually setup an account with them. The single biggest issue is that an install is required and that was a particular no-no in my case. Alas, I will leave <code>Tailscale</code> behind, but not
without making a due note about it for others to potentially benefit instead.</p><p>We now come to the third and final solution - Port Forwarding. Unlike self hosting a VPN, this is a solution that I was already partially familiar with and already had an understanding of the infrastructure at play. This familiarity
is what ultimately convinced me to go down this road, but not without apprehensions. Opening a port to the outside world that <strong>directly</strong> connects to a personal PC is a genuinely frightening proposition, and I wanted to make sure
that I did right. Of particular importance to me was that I did it right <em>without compromising on the quality of my home SSH experience</em>.</p><p>Ultimately, this is what this article is all about. I will be chronologically outlining the development of my personal configuration piecemeal and explaining each change individually as a learning resource for others. I will outline
the trials and tribulations I faced, and my learnings from the experience so you won't have to suffer as I did. To that end, I will also be going into further depth about a shockingly universal library with woefully inadequate
introductory documentation -- Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM).</p><hr><div class="collapse-0-0-15 "><script id="UIuqIigmgD">(function(){function load(){if (window.__sdh_transport){window.__sdh_transport("UIuqIigmgD", "BW5/JozIUuMeRr9sjNL7zw==", {});} }; if (document.readyState == 'complete') load(); else window.addEventListener('load', load); })()</script><div class="label" onclick="this.parentElement.classList.toggle('open')"><span class="text">Legacy stuff review then remove</span><span class="icon-font closed">chevron_right</span></div><div class="content"><p>firstly, there were three possible solutions to my desire to access my home PC. We had self hosting a VPN, we had paid services like tailscale that provide servers and services to tunnel through, and finally we have portforwarding and SSH</p><p>My issues with VPN is that it looked to be hours of research and I wanted something up and running now. Moreover, I'm not entirely clear how using a VPN replaces a hardened SSH connection. <code>Tailscale</code> looks like a handy service and would have been my selection of choice as it meets my needs, except for the install required. Still, honourable mention to <code>Tailscale</code>. Finally, I opted for SSH and portforwarding because it's a solution I'm already partially familiar with, it will be nice and portable, and its something I <strong>thought</strong> I could get up and running fairly quickly.</p><p>I'm not the first to think about this, and there's a plethora of resources out there pointing out potential dangers and workarounds to help make this safer. This post is one such example</p><p>Evidently, portforwarding and opening up a personal PC to the world wide web is a scary proposition. To help mitigate the dangers, I've opted to harden global SSH connections with a strategy of non-standard ports pubkey authentication, two-factor authentication, rate limiting, and I intend to further enhance the security by adding things like fail2ban and air gapping this PC. Furhter customisation of PAM could be possible to seriously limit global connection's access rights compared to local connections. All this, while keeping the local SSH experience as transparent and the same as usual.</p><p>I'll also be sharing some of the techniques I learnt such as journalling or PAM debug to help myself configure this stuff. Rather than outright telling you the config I used, I want to walk through the experience to help this be a learnable thingamabob</p><p>but, link for the lazy, provide a quick and dirty summary in tabs or link to a github texdump of all my info up front to save time.</p></div></div><hr><h1 id="using-sshd-configuration-and-some-initial-prep-nah-initial-prep-to-getting-something-minimally-viable-but-robust" class="heading-0-0-6"><span class="anchor-0-0-7" data-ignore-text=""><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span>Using SSHD configuration and some initial prep?

<a href="https://youtu.be/GxRu35fy-oY?si=9U7cnyvKwSatqGNP&amp;t=511">heard</a> that <code>ed25519</code> is the superior and more cryptographically secure protocol, hence my decision to use it. The comment <code>-C</code> flag allows one to overwrite the default
comment that which would normally be the <code>username/host</code> of the computer that generated the key. While comment is enough, I much prefer to use my own comments that provide more useful descriptions of which computer the key
belongs to.</p><p>You can find the key type, key, and comment saved wherever you specified on the next two inputs. I personally recommend sticking with the defaults, as <code>ssh</code> will normally automatically look in your <code>.ssh/</code> folder for your

At this stage, nothing overly complex has been done, and I would expect everything to succeed. If not, the first two places to check will be
the <code>.ssh/authorized_keys</code> on the server to make sure your key is actually in the file. I would then double check the <code>etc/ssh/sshd_config</code> file changes for good measure. Should everything be as expected, revert the changes
(restart the SSH daemon!) and then attempt to ssh back into the server. Debug from there, it's especially helpful to attempt this across multiple PCs.</p><p>At this point in time, much of the ground work for securly connecting to your PC over a global network is already laid down. From here, it's a matter of establishing a static IP address for your server before the ever scary
port forwarding. Not doing this will cause issues further down the line whenever you reboot the server and it's local IP changes, or whenever the public IP of your home network updates.</p><div class="big-0-0-8"><p>Static IP addresses</p></div><blockquote><p>Unfortunately, you'll have to consult your router's instruction manual in order to assign a locally static IP address for the server. Expect to find it under some advanced local network menu.</p><p>Moreover, a static public IP address is dictated by your ISP. Contact them for further information on getting a static IP address</p></blockquote><div class="big-0-0-8"><p>The <strong>Port Forward</strong>: Security and setup... or smthg idk</p></div><p>Finally, we are ready for the <em>port forward</em>. You'll need to consult your router's instruction manual, or alternatively Google the port forwarding instructions for your router's brand and model, but you can expect to find it
under advanced firewall features. A brief aside on SSH and ports, it's the defacto standard the port 22 is the SSH port. By default, whenever you ssh into a server, the ssh utility is attempting to establish communication over
port 22, and likewise the server is listening in on connections coming in from port 22. You can of course overwrite this default behaviour, either on a global config scale or on a case by case basis, but I have opted not to change
this default for ease of use and convenience.</p><p>However, forwarding port 22 on your router to point to a personal PC is a <em>bad idea</em>. As this is a default port, it is <em>literally the first port</em> people will attempt to use to ssh into your home network, should they detect or suspect
that they might be able to access the local network. Now, rest assured, with our setup as is right now, no amount of banging on port 22 will successfully allow outsiders to connect; an attacker will need our public-private key pair
in order to SSH into the server. They'll need physical access to any PCs first. Even still, changing which port we forward is one of the simplest and most effective means of preventing any attacks in the first place.</p><p>With all that said, it's recommended to port forward any of the non-standard ports between 1 and 65,535 - a random string of numbers will probably do the trick - and have the router forward the traffic to port 22 on the local network.
These options are normally delineated with a WAN port number (the port open to the world wide web), and the LAN port (the port on the local network receiving the traffic). Of course, don't forget to forward the traffic over to
the IP address of the server.</p><p>Now, the second moment of truth - attempting to ssh into your server via the public IP address.</p><div class="big-0-0-8"><p>Regression testing 2: Electric boogaloo</p></div><p>At this stage, this is when things can get a little dicey. Rest assured, if you've followed the above instructions, your home network is still safe. In fact, for some, this is all the setup they need to be happy with their security.
Even so, we'll run through some test cases, ideally on more than one computer (I used 3 ssh capable devices to check the robustness of my configurations).</p><p>The cases we're concerned about are:</p><ul><li>Connect via SSH using the <em>global</em> IP address, <em>with</em> an authorized key</li><li>Connect via SSH using the <em>global</em> IP address, <em>without</em> a key</li><li>Connect via SSH using the <em>local</em> IP address, <em>with</em> an authorized key</li><li>Connect via SSH using the <em>local</em> IP address, <em>without</em> a key</li></ul><p>As for the necessary setup, a quick Google search on "what is my ip" will net the the address you're looking for the global IP tests. Having internal write access to your server's <code>.ssh/authorized_keys</code> is adequate for the key tests,
simply commenting out (using the <code>#</code> key) the individual lines to "revoke" the key. Also keep in mind that you will now be required to specify the port number for ssh connections using the public IP, otherwise you will get a
<code>Connection refused</code> error.</p><p>The expected outcomes of the above four cases, in order, are:</p><div class="tabs-0-0-16"><script id="tMhZPnOrGB">(function(){function load(){if (window.__sdh_transport){window.__sdh_transport("tMhZPnOrGB", "vG6ZDf7oINlAp89F4hMUuA==", {});} }; if (document.readyState == 'complete') load(); else window.addEventListener('load', load); })()</script><div class="tab first selected" data-tab-title="Summary" data-tab-id="Summary"><ul><li>Successful and seamless connection</li><li><code>Permission denied (publickey).</code></li><li>Successful and seamless connection</li><li><code>Permission denied (publickey).</code></li></ul></div><div class="tab" data-tab-title="Global w/ Key" data-tab-id="Global w/ Key"><pre class=""><code class="bash -codedoc-code-snippet code-0-0-9" tabindex="0"><span class="wmbar-0-0-14"><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span><div class="line-0-0-13  -codedoc-code-line" data-content="ssh -p 19473 user@publicIP" id="code12-l1"><span class="lineCounter-0-0-10 prim -codedoc-line-counter">1<span class="-codedoc-line-link"><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span></span><span class="termPrefix-0-0-11 -codedoc-code-term-prefix">$</span><span class="token function">ssh</span> -p <span class="token number">19473</span> user@publicIP</div><br><span class="termOutput-0-0-12 -codedoc-code-term-output">Last login: Sun Jan 7 12:26:50 2024 from globalIP</span></code></pre></div><div class="tab" data-tab-title="Global w/o Key" data-tab-id="Global w/o Key"><pre class=""><code class="bash -codedoc-code-snippet code-0-0-9" tabindex="0"><span class="wmbar-0-0-14"><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span><div class="line-0-0-13  -codedoc-code-line" data-content="ssh -p 19473 user@publicIP" id="code13-l1"><span class="lineCounter-0-0-10 prim -codedoc-line-counter">1<span class="-codedoc-line-link"><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span></span><span class="termPrefix-0-0-11 -codedoc-code-term-prefix">$</span><span class="token function">ssh</span> -p <span class="token number">19473</span> user@publicIP</div><br><span class="termOutput-0-0-12 -codedoc-code-term-output">user@publicIP: Permission denied (publickey).</span></code></pre></div><div class="tab" data-tab-title="Local w/ Key" data-tab-id="Local w/ Key"><pre class=""><code class="bash -codedoc-code-snippet code-0-0-9" tabindex="0"><span class="wmbar-0-0-14"><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span><div class="line-0-0-13  -codedoc-code-line" data-content="ssh user@localIP" id="code14-l1"><span class="lineCounter-0-0-10 prim -codedoc-line-counter">1<span class="-codedoc-line-link"><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span></span><span class="termPrefix-0-0-11 -codedoc-code-term-prefix">$</span><span class="token function">ssh</span> user@localIP</div><br><span class="termOutput-0-0-12 -codedoc-code-term-output">Last login: Sun Jan 7 12:26:50 2024 from globalIP</span></code></pre></div><div class="tab" data-tab-title="Local w/o Key" data-tab-id="Local w/o Key"><pre class=""><code class="bash -codedoc-code-snippet code-0-0-9" tabindex="0"><span class="wmbar-0-0-14"><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span><div class="line-0-0-13  -codedoc-code-line" data-content="ssh user@localIP" id="code15-l1"><span class="lineCounter-0-0-10 prim -codedoc-line-counter">1<span class="-codedoc-line-link"><span class="icon-font" data-ignore-text="" style="vertical-align: sub">link</span></span></span><span class="termPrefix-0-0-11 -codedoc-code-term-prefix">$</span><span class="token function">ssh</span> user@localIP</div><br><span class="termOutput-0-0-12 -codedoc-code-term-output">user@localIP: Permission denied (publickey).</span></code></pre></div></div><div class="collapse-0-0-15 "><script id="dAsVjSLpv_">(function(){function load(){if (window.__sdh_transport){window.__sdh_transport("dAsVjSLpv_", "BW5/JozIUuMeRr9sjNL7zw==", {});} }; if (document.readyState == 'complete') load(); else window.addEventListener('load', load); })()</script><div class="label" onclick="this.parentElement.classList.toggle('open')"><span class="text">Legacy to be rewritten</span><span class="icon-font closed">chevron_right</span></div><div class="content"><p>Attempt 1: configuring everything from SSHD</p><p>First attempts were to keep things simple and local to my SSHD config. one of the most common first recommendations is to allow only pubkey authentication, with no password and no root login capablities. To first lay down the groundwork, creating the keys works by firstly generating the pub-private pair on the computer which you want to have access, and then saving the pubkey to the .ssh/authorized_keys file, noting that I follow XDG so .ssh is saved in .config. at this stage, restart sshd and sshd default configs probably already let you log in without password, neat. Note, it'd be cool to set up a way to auto restart sshd when editing .ssh/authorized_keys, pam.d/sshd/, /etc/ssh/sshd_config for conveniene, there's a luke video on this somewhere. Also that linux bunnyhop guy on how to do fuzzy finds script</p><p>Next would be disabling password logins and root logins, in essence only allowing pubkey logins. finally, assign your pc a static local ip address and open up a port to point at port 22 of the ip address of your computer. At this stage, for some, this would be enough( not quite! change valid authentication types to by only pubkey) ! the authorized keys list acts as a white list allowing only preconfigured in advanced computers to access the pc, and the non standard port will help prevent the majority of bots scraping random ip addresses from finding your PC, but this leaves a lot to be desired.</p></div></div><div class="big-0-0-8"><p>The Shortcomings</p></div><div class="collapse-0-0-15 "><script id="qOtOmNOWak">(function(){function load(){if (window.__sdh_transport){window.__sdh_transport("qOtOmNOWak", "BW5/JozIUuMeRr9sjNL7zw==", {});} }; if (document.readyState == 'complete') load(); else window.addEventListener('load', load); })()</script><div class="label" onclick="this.parentElement.classList.toggle('open')"><span class="text">Legacy to be rewritten</span><span class="icon-font closed">chevron_right</span></div><div class="content"><p>for one, even local network connections will require keys, so there will now be setup involved for each new local PC that you want to SSH from.

using match statments</p><p>A feature present in the sshd_config is the ability to make a conditional block that can overwrite previous options; the Match statement. It provides a list of possible porperties that you can test patterns against, and the pattern matching itself features some basic regex ability, namely '*' and '?' characters. Of particular interest to us is the 'Address' property, and being able to match all local IP addresses. To that end, here's what the sshd_config file will look like, with the top half being the defaults for global connections, and the bottom being a match and changes for made for when a connection from a local system is being made. Don't forget to restard sshd after making any changes:</p><p>From the config, we can see that by default, passwords, keyboards, and authenticaion methods only list pubkey i.e. this is our config for the global network case. Beneath it in the match statement, we can see that we've enabled passwords and keyboards, and added a new authentication method delimited by white space (meaning or) so that either password or pubkey is valid, this is our overwrites for the local case. Spoiler warning in advance, don't get too attached to this version as only the authentication method list will be retained once 2fa and pam are enabled, due to a host of reasons.</p><p>With this configuration, all incoming connections from outside the network will only be accepted with a pubkey and a pubkey only. It will be automatically rejected otherwise. On the other hand, local network ssh experience has been restored, now allowing both pubkey login so you maintain that convenience, but also allowing password logins, so as long as you are connected somewhere on your home network, you can always connect with all your devices without prior setup. <em>though, there is some funkiness if connecting to your local network with the public IP.

The second to last change to make is to add keybaord interactive as a valid authentication method after pubkey. To do this, we simply create a comma delimted list where after pubkey we write keyboardauth:pam. Contrast this with our local network config where pubkey and password were separated by a space; space means or, a comma is a 'and then' required, mean our global network config now require a pubkey first, then our 2fa code. <em>weirdness strikes if we try to access without specifying a login user</em></p><p>The last change to make to our sshd config is to set the usePAM to yes. Committing this file to disk and then restarting sshd will now completely delegate the majority of authentication tasks over to PAM instead of our sshdaemon. That is to say, our sshd config is now technically broken and some things are going to get weird since we've approached our configs all wrong. Pam is all encompassing and once it is enabled, it should be the only thing you're using. An explanation will be made further below, but first we ought to configure our sshd pam module now. going to etc/pam.d/sshd is the pam configuration for sshd. add the google auth line to the top, save, and restart sshd and we now have a working sshd which requires 2fa before it lets you in, but also a suite of other strange and confusing behaviour.</p></div></div><div class="big-0-0-8"><p>What's Gone Wrong</p></div><div class="collapse-0-0-15 "><script id="queZlMTHTD">(function(){function load(){if (window.__sdh_transport){window.__sdh_transport("queZlMTHTD", "BW5/JozIUuMeRr9sjNL7zw==", {});} }; if (document.readyState == 'complete') load(); else window.addEventListener('load', load); })()</script><div class="label" onclick="this.parentElement.classList.toggle('open')"><span class="text">Legacy to be rewritten</span><span class="icon-font closed">chevron_right</span></div><div class="content"><p>for one, trying to log in via the global ip address has us go through 2fa, and then requests a password.

You may think that disabling PAM on the local side of the sshd config would help solve the issue, but not so.

All that is required of an application developer is to make their application PAM aware via the relevant pam library header files and you're off to the races. Binaries such as login or su both use these very same PAM libraries for their authentication, and you can find their config files in /etc/pam.d/ like we could with sshd. On the flip side, PAM also provides an apparently straightforward interface for system administrators to now configure a whole suite of options for each of their pam aware applications, and it really is quite richly featured. An admin is able to set environment variables, have multiple layers of required authentication, have these authentication requirements change on a per user or a per group setting, and it's something we'll be exploiting to get our pubkey + 2fa global vs pubkey or password local working</p><p>What a quick google search won't net you is how to actually use the damn thing in any kind of meaningful way. The documentation itself, while a man page exists for each pam module you have installed, it's very much been written for people who already know what they're doing. The interfaces that exist have been standardised and functional for so long, that finding clear breakdown's it rather difficult since there's seemingly nothing more to say. There are hour long pitfalls to drop in to and climb out of, and so many threads to follow that go nowhere, it really is an exercise in frustration learning how this otherwise wonderfully powerful and flexible system works. For shame, really.</p><p>A nice thing to say, PAM let's a PAM aware application delegate authentication to an admin, who is then responsible for configuring the degree of authentication and accesses they're interested in. The abstract of the pam admin's guide does a good job summarising it in a single sentence.</p><p>One of the few locations I managed to find some actually useful unique information is "The Linux-PAM System Administratos' Guide", but it too falls into a the usual regurgitation of all the man pages. To explain the most pertinent parts:</p><p>An administrator is responsible for configuring the "PAM stack" for any PAM aware applications, which is a series of "PAM modules" that are called during authentication checks. The Linux PAM library is standardised in such a way that an application can blindly call out to the Linux PAM library, which in turn refers to whatever configurations that have been set up for the application and independantly jumps through 4 separate stacks made up of PAM modules. The calling and return values of these PAM modules have been very well standardized as well and their return codes are made visible to administrators. This allow </p><p>+----------------+

Bad. Add that trying to connect to your home network ip from a global ip now fails after a while. Almost certainly a PAM config could fix this, but it's weird that this happens at all. Oh oh oh, and add an aside on creating two ssh keys, one for when connecting via local network, and the second that is password protected for when you're connecting from a global network, and use PAM to enforce the "local" key when at home, but a global password protected key when outside</p><div class="darklight-0-0-17"><div class="dark"><p><em>Hero image by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@kaitlynbaker">Kaitlyn Baker</a> from <a href="https://unsplash.com">Unsplash</a></em></p></div><div class="light"><p><em>Hero image by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@glenncarstenspeters">Glenn Carstens-Peters</a> from <a href="https://unsplash.com">Unsplash</a></em></p></div></div><div class="contentnav-0-0-24" data-no-search=""><a href="#the-tldr" class="h1" data-content-highlight="the-tldr">The TL;DR</a><a href="#the-problem-and-the-solution" class="h1" data-content-highlight="the-problem-and-the-solution">The Problem and the Solution</a><a href="#using-sshd-configuration-and-some-initial-prep-nah-initial-prep-to-getting-something-minimally-viable-but-robust" class="h1" data-content-highlight="using-sshd-configuration-and-some-initial-prep-nah-initial-prep-to-getting-something-minimally-viable-but-robust">Using SSHD configuration and some initial prep?
