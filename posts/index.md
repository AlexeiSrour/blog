# Sample Blog Post

This is a sample post for your `coding.blog` blog. Change contents of `posts/index.md`
and see your changes live. When you are done, simply push to _master_, then head to [your account](https://coding.blog/blog)
and press the publish button. Alternatively, you can use the webhook provided in the same page
to make automated publishes per _master_ push.

This boilerplate is equipped with some useful blogging components. Read on the following pages
to learn how to utilize them. It is also highly recommended to checkout the official docs of [**CODEDOC**](https://codedoc.cc),
so that you have a better idea of what features **CODEDOC** puts at your disposal for your blog posts.
