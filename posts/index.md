# Sample Blog Post

This is a sample post for your `coding.blog` blog. Change contents of `posts/index.md`
and see your changes live. When you are done, simply push to _master_, then head to [your account](https://coding.blog/blog)
and press the publish button. Alternatively, you can use the webhook provided in the same page
to make automated publishes per _master_ push.

`coding.blog` is based on [**CODEDOC**](https://codedoc.cc). Checkout the official documentations
of **CODEDOC** to learn more about how it works and how you can utilize it to create your blog.
