There are three primary purposes for this blog's existence:
- As a record of account of my learnings in all topics that I've taken an interest in - past, present, and future.
- As an archive and reference of my own knowledge and, in particular, links to other sources for that knowledge.
- As an environment to share and explore knowledge between individuals

To that end, in order to achieve said purpose,  I'd like for this blog to host not only posts which should be self contained
and completed write ups on a particular topic, but to also maintain a "todo" list of sorts, for ideas and/or projects that are
currently queued, as well as a "current" list to keep tabs on what I'm working on concurrently.

Each post should maintain a solid references list, and an additional recommended readings/texts page ought to be maintained that
list a majority of the most useful texts used. Breakdowns and a description of the text with reason fo recommendation will be
provided and information/links/metadata provided for convenient retrieval of said texts.

A means to comment under posts ought to be facilitated. Perhaps further contact details ought to be provided to social media
to further allow individuals to share posts or comment directly to the author with further information. Finally, a key requirement
of hosting the blog will be organised, most likely via GitHub pages.


This is a sample homepage for your [`coding.blog`](https://coding.blog). You can use
it to showcase your latest / most-important blog posts (or whatever suites your case).
You can modify its content by editting `posts/index.md`.
