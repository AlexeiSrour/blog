This page is another work in progress that, for now, will list out all of the created blog posts in chronological order

For the timebeing, links to blog posts will be added manually in chronological order, but the hope is to eventually extend the deployment (e.g. using a script) to add new blog posts to this page automatically. I'd then like to eventually extend this page further, maybe via the use of [categories via tags](:Tag) on each individual blog post to be able to sort the contents of this page by date (fine grained and coarse grained) as well as by cartegory (again, coarse grained like "comp sci" or "linux admin" and fine grained like "vulkan renderer" or "PAM"). Such sorting might not be achievable for quite a while, so to that end I may need to create a secondary "list of all blog posts" but automatically categorised (e.g. via a script) for convenience in the meantime.

# To-do

- create script to add newly created blog posts to this page
- create script to enforce all added pages are correctly tagged
- create a means of overwriting date field with original posting date in the event of edits
- include some means on each page to return to the listing of all blog posts
- include some means on each page to move on to the next/prev blog post in chronological order
- include some means on each page to move on to the next/prev blog post within the category
