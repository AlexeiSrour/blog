> To-do Listing

This page will list out my currently queued tasks related to this blog's themes, small actionable items that should be completable within a single weekend.

This page will also list out current projects, these are multi month tasks that tend to be worked towards piecemeal, and have a tendancy to be shelved and
swapped out with other projects on a whim.

Related to current projects will be the project queue, which will serve as a list of other projects that are swapped in to/out of.

# To-Do

- create blog post based off research of using rdtsc(p) correctly
- create blog post based off OS Three Easy Pieces homework on timing syscalls and context switches (include /usr/bin/time)
- create blog post based off context switches and speculation on why they're expensive
- create blog post based off assembly analysis of "tell compiler what you know" article using restrict and __builtin_assume
- create blog post based off TSO and sequential consistency research
- create blog post based off ISPC and research for vectorising code.
- review a number of research I have to make blogs off
- configure data for references page (might require custom component?)
- might need to create a new component in place of ToCPrevNext so that next/prev buttons go to separate places

# Completed

This section is here just to make me feel good about myself, hopefully. Just migrate all completed projects over to this section as they are done.
Maybe have a retired section too? Or even a pile of shame, heh :'(
