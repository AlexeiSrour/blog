The specific implementtion of the reference list may be a work in progress for quite some time. For now, just keep it as a flat list
of names while I figure out the details.

I have in mind that this will be a "global" list of all references ever used in any post. The schema I'm imagining is something like
title, reference, doi, links, description on why I recommend it. A post will then grab the data from the list and my locally overried
any of the metadata, e.g. to cutomise the description to make it more relevant to the post.

a list of tags ould be good to categorise each paper into one or more ways
